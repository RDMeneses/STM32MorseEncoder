# STM32MorseEncoder
An embedded project using an STM32F411 Blackpill board to encode and play Morse code messages via a buzzer, with real-time character display on an OLED. Built with STM32CubeIDE, the project features hardcoded messages selectable by a button, PWM-based buzzer control, and I2C-driven OLED updates.
